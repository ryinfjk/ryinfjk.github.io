    <p class="title1">What is Full Stack Development?</p>

    <div>
        <p class="p1">A full stack developer is someone who works with both the front end and back end of a
            web application. The front end is responsible for the visual look and feel of the website, 
            while back end is responsible for the behind the scenes logic and infrastructure of the
            site.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="title2">What Does a Full Stack Developer Do?</p>

    <div>
        <p class="p2">Full stack developers take on a broad set of responsibilities. They must be fluent in
            creating websites with a robust internal architecture and delivering an interactive and
            intuitive interface to clients. A full stack developer must be well-versed in HTML, CSS,
            and JavaScript and know their way around back end technologies and database
            structures. 

            <br>
            <br>
            
            These professionals usually work with a product through its initial creation until its final
            launch, using industry-standard practices to ensure that technical concerns are
            adequately addressed at every development stack level. 

            <br>
            <br>

            Full stack developers start by brainstorming platforms alongside a graphic design team, 
            often reviewing prototypes before turning them into coded products. Then, these multi-
            talented programmers craft functional databases and servers to support client-facing
            content, always evaluating how responsive an app is for end-users and troubleshooting
            problems as necessary.

            <br>
            <br>

            The best full stack developers also keep abreast of current industry trends and emerging<br> 
            technologies and understand how to deploy upcoming technologies to suit their<br> 
            employers needs.

            <br>
            <br>

            <strong>Everyday responsibilities of the profession include:</strong>
            
            <br>

                    client-facing platforms

                <li>Managing databases and servers</li>

                <li>Coding for functionality across multiple languages and platforms
                </li>

                <li>Communicating with specialized developers and the graphic design team to deliver<br> 
                    the best possible product
                </li>

                <li>Keeping up with emerging technology that may serve the business needs
                </li>
