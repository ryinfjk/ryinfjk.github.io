            when in the Philippines.

            nicknamed as The Blue Lagoon and surrounded by tall limestone formations, making the area look and feel
            very secluded. Either enjoy the view or take a dip, the choice is up to you! If you want to see underwater 
            artifacts from the 40s, you'll enjoy wreck diving in the waters of Coron. There are different sites with 
            varying levels of depth, with some even visible to snorkelers. Take a break from the sea by going on a safari 
            tour when you visit the Calauit Game Refuge and Wildlife Sanctuary. Here, you'll be able to spot African
            gazelles, zebras and brown deer. End the day on a relaxing note by taking a dip at the Maniquit Hot Springs 
            or watch the sunset from the top of Mt. Tapyas.
